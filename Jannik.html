            <h1>About Jannik Sinner:</h1>
            <h3>Jannik Sinner is a 23 year old Italian born professional junior skier turned professional tennis player that,
                alongside Carlos Alcaraz, challenges the barrier of the untouchable big three from the previous generation. Sinner
                would eventually give up his career as a professional skier to fully commit to tennis. Sinner would make a name for 
                himself in 2019 as he would defeat high caliber players such as Steve Johnson, Gael Monfils, and Alex de Minaur. Sinner
                would earn himself the ATP Newcomer of the Year award alongside a Performance of the Year award after defeating world 
                number 18, Alex de Minaur in straight sets. <br><br>
                Due to the pandemic in 2020, there were not many titles or tournaments that Sinner could travel to, so his tennis 
                journey was temporarily stalled. However, in 2021, similarly to Alcaraz, Sinner really made a name for himself as he 
                reaches the finals of the Miamo Open, Masters 1000, only to lose to Hubert Hurkacz. Sinner would enter the top 15 
                after reaching the fourth round of the French Open at Roland Garros where he would lose to Rafael Nadal. Sinner would
                once again reach the fourth round of another grand slam, but fall short and lose to Alexander Zverev. However, Sinner
                would quietly collect five ATP titles and end the year as world number ten. <br><br>
                In 2022, Sinner would make substantial progress from previous years, consistently entering the quarter finals of
                every grand slam except the French Open. However, he would always fall short losing to top tier players such as 
                Tsisipas, Alcaraz, and Djokovic. Due to an injury and some unfortunate early tournament losses, Sinner would end his 
                2022 season at number 15. <br><br>
                2023 and 2024 is when Sinner truly broke through his skill ceiling despite some off the court struggles. He establishes
                a true rivalry against rank one Carlos Alcaraz. He would re-enter the top ten after beating Rublev, Dimitrov, and Alcaraz 
                but fall short to his Russian kryptonite/counterpart Daniil Medvedev (with an 0-6 head to head matchup at this point).
                Sinner would reach the Wimbledon finals but ultimately lose to Djokovic. However, he would end the year strong at the China
                Open, defeating Alcaraz and Medvedev. <br><br>
                In 2024, Sinner starts the year incredibly hot as he reaches the semi finals of the Australian Open without
                dropping a single set. Sinner would go on to beat Djokovic in the semis and overcome Medvedev in the grand finals
                despite a two set deficit. Sinner's streak would come to a halt as he meets Alcaraz in the semi finals of Indian Wells.
                However, it would reignited as he beats Dimitrov at the Miami Open, reaching a high of number two with a record of 22 to 1,
                with his only loss to his rival, Alcaraz. Sinner would eventually overtake Djokovic for rank number one due to injury, 
                but he would fall short due to illness himself at Wimbledon against Medvedev. In August, an anti-doping case would open 
                against Sinner, but there is insufficient evidence to prove that Sinner knowingly took performance enhancing drugs. 
                Sinner would then go on to win the US Open beating Medvedev, Draper, and Fritz, crowning himself as the hard court king,
                after earning both hard court slam titles and ending the year as rank number one.
