            <h1>About Roger Federer:</h1>
            <h3>Roger Federer's tennis career is an extraordinary tale of dominance, innovation, and adaptability. Turning 
                pro in 1998, Federer made his breakthrough by winning Wimbledon in 2003, a title he went on to claim eight 
                times — a record in men's singles. This victory marked the beginning of his Golden Era, where he displayed 
                unparalleled consistency and dominance.<br><br>
                Between 2004 and 2007, Federer was virtually unbeatable, capturing 11 titles each year from 2004 to 2006 
                and culminating in a career-best 12 titles in 2006, which included three Grand Slams: the Australian Open, 
                Wimbledon, and the US Open. Remarkably, he reached 10 consecutive Grand Slam finals during this period. 
                His dominance also extended to ranking records, holding the World No. 1 spot for a record 237 consecutive 
                weeks during these years​.<br><br>
                Federer showed great adaptability and resilience later in his career. Though injuries began to surface, 
                notably his recurring back issues in 2013 and knee surgeries in 2016 and 2020, he made inspiring comebacks.
                After a six-month hiatus in 2016, Federer returned in 2017 with a vengeance, winning the Australian Open 
                and Wimbledon, proving he was still a force to be reckoned with at age 35. His 20th and final Grand Slam 
                title came at the 2018 Australian Open. <br><br>
                Off the court, Federer’s partnerships with sponsors highlighted his global appeal. In 2018, he ended his 
                long-term association with Nike, a deal that had spanned most of his career. He then signed a $300 million 
                deal with Uniqlo, showcasing his growing influence beyond tennis. Additionally, Federer became a global 
                ambassador for ON, a Swiss running shoe company, further expanding his business ventures while actively 
                contributing to their product design and marketing​. <br><br>
                Federer retired in 2022 as one of the most decorated players in tennis history with 103 ATP titles and 
                20 Grand Slam wins. His ability to combine technical finesse with mental toughness, along with his work 
                ethic and charm, made him a global icon transcending the sport​. <br><br>
