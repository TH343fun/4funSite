            <h1>About Carlos Alcaraz: </h1>
            <h3>Carlos is a 21 year old Spanish born professional tennis player that exploded onto the professional tour
                in 2021 where he earned his first ATP title, entered the top 100 as the younger player at 18, and defeated
                players such as Richard Gasquet, Marton Fucsovics, and Stefanos Tsitsipas. The following year, Alcaraz's 
                terror would not halt, as he entered the top 10 in April after defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Barcelona 
                Open. <br><br>
                At the Madrid open, one day after his birthday, Alcaraz would go on to defeat his tennis idol, Spanish legend 
                Rafael Nadal in the quarter finals. He would become the first teenager to best Nadal on clay, only to continue
                his hot streak, defeating another legendary player, Novak Djokovic in the semi finals. Alcaraz would go on to 
                achieve his second Masters 1000 title, defeating Alexander Zverev and placing him at rank 6 in the world. 
                <br><br>
                The 2022 US Open would become Alcaraz's first grand slam title as he teared through Jannik Sinner, Frances Tiafoe,
                and Casper Ruud, cementing his status as the youngest world number one at 19 years, 4 months, and 6 days of age. 
                Alcaraz would eventually end his 2022 at the very top as rank one, and continue to dominate the scene with his 
                wide array of tools including his unbelievable drop shot. <br><br>
                In 2023, Alcaraz continued to collect titles such as 2023 Indian Wells, often labelled the sixth grand slam,
                the Madrid Open (Masters 1000), in addition to winning the coveted Wimbledon title, defeating Novak Djokovic in a 
                five set thriller. This year, Alcaraz has continued to trample through the competition, once again winning the Indian
                Wells title, the French Grand Slam at Roland Garros, Wimbledon, and the silver medal at the Paris Summer Olympic Games.
